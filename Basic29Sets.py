#SETS: Containers with the same meaning they do in mathematics(KÃ¼meler)
#No dublicates, they are removed. sets are used with brackets { }

# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# print(set1.union(set2))        # Union
# print(set1.intersection(set2))  # Intersection
# print(set1.difference(set2))   # Difference
